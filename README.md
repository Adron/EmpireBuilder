# Empire Builder 🚆

This project has been built to provide an cross-platform graphical interface to the rail logistics database that I've built. To use this client for the database, you'll need to sign up at XXXXXX site for an account and apply for administrator access. This currently means ping Adron (i.e. that's me, the originator of this project) and we'll get your FRN credentials certified and pending you know your routes and power units, I'll add ya ASAP to the administrator list! 👍'

## Architecture of Application 💫
